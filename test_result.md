# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

However, I encountered an issue where navigating to /admin or clicking the 'Единая Админка' button in the header redirects to the homepage instead of showing the admin login form. This suggests there might be an issue with the React Router configuration or authentication logic in the admin panel. The HTTP request to /admin returns a 200 status code, but the browser redirects to the homepage. This could be due to a client-side redirect in the React code. I recommend checking the routing configuration in App.js and any authentication/redirect logic in the UnifiedAdminPanel component."

    message: "I've conducted the final delivery test of the neurosurgery center website. Here are my findings: 1) Website public pages: Homepage, About page, Departments page, Doctors page, Gallery page, and News page all display correctly. However, the language switcher doesn't change the text properly when switching between RU/UZ/EN. 2) Services page: The page loads but doesn't show 5 services with prices as required. 3) Admin panel: Login works with admin@neuro.uz/admin123, and all sections (Dashboard, Appointments, Departments, Doctors, Services, Leadership, News, Gallery, Events, Users) are accessible. However, some sections like Leadership and Services don't display content properly. 4) JavaScript errors: There are still errors related to incorrect casing of React components (Activity, Brain, Heart). 5) Mobile responsiveness: The website is properly responsive on mobile devices with a working mobile menu. 6) Branding: Page title shows 'NEURO.UZ - Центр Нейрохирургии' correctly, and there's no 'Made with Emergent' badge. Overall, the website is functional but needs fixes for the language switcher, services page, and JavaScript errors before final delivery."
