# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

However, I encountered an issue where navigating to /admin or clicking the 'Единая Админка' button in the header redirects to the homepage instead of showing the admin login form. This suggests there might be an issue with the React Router configuration or authentication logic in the admin panel. The HTTP request to /admin returns a 200 status code, but the browser redirects to the homepage. This could be due to a client-side redirect in the React code. I recommend checking the routing configuration in App.js and any authentication/redirect logic in the UnifiedAdminPanel component."

        comment: "Tested the gallery categories management functionality. Verified that the Gallery section has a 'Категории галереи' block at the top showing 4 categories (Здание, Оборудование, Персонал, События). Each category displays translation status indicators (RU: ✓, UZ: ✓/✗, EN: ✓/✗). The 'Добавить категорию' button opens a modal window with language switching functionality. Edit and delete buttons are present for each category. The language switching in the modal works correctly, showing the appropriate field labels based on the selected language."

Verified that the settings are divided into 3 columns as required: 1) Контактная информация (with phone numbers, email addresses, and physical address), 2) Социальные сети (with fields for Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and official website), 3) SEO настройки (with fields for site title, description, and keywords). The '+ Добавить' buttons for adding phones and emails are present and functional. Social media sections have appropriate icons for each platform."

        comment: "Tested the unified admin panel with website synchronization. The 'Единая Админка' button is visible in the header and clicking it successfully navigates to the admin login page with the new design 'Единая Админ-панель'. Login with admin@neuro.uz/admin123 credentials works properly. After login, the admin panel dashboard is displayed with statistics showing the number of departments, doctors, leadership, and news. All navigation tabs (Панель управления, Записи на сегодня, Отделения, Врачи, Услуги, Руководство, Новости, Галерея, События) are visible and functional. The Leadership section shows existing leaders and has a working 'Добавить руководителя' button that opens a modal form. The synchronization with the website works correctly - when viewing the About page, the leadership section displays the same leaders as in the admin panel. There are some minor React component errors in the console related to incorrect casing for components like Activity, Brain, and Heart, but these don't affect the core functionality of the admin panel or the synchronization with the website."

        comment: "Retested the unified admin panel with focus on the leadership section and synchronization. The leadership names now match exactly between the admin panel and the 'О центре' page. When editing a leadership entry in the admin panel, the changes are immediately reflected on the 'О центре' page. No localStorage quota errors were observed during testing. The localStorage implementation has been fixed to handle large data properly."

    message: "Attempted to test the multilingual admin panel functionality as requested. The homepage loads correctly and the 'Админ-панель' link is visible in the header. However, I encountered issues accessing the admin panel - when clicking on the admin panel link or navigating directly to /admin, the page redirects to the homepage instead of showing the login form. This suggests there might be an issue with the admin panel routing or authentication flow. The console shows some React component errors related to incorrect casing for components like Activity, Brain, and Heart, but these appear to be minor styling issues rather than critical functionality problems."

    message: "Retested the leadership section on the About page. Verified that all requested changes have been implemented successfully: 1) Photos are now significantly larger (w-48 h-48, 192x192px), 2) Photos have rectangular shape with rounded corners (rounded-2xl), 3) Photos have shadow (shadow-lg) and border (ring-4 ring-blue-100), 4) Cards are taller (min-h-[500px]), 5) Cards have more padding (p-10), 6) Responsive design works correctly (1 column on mobile, 2 columns on tablet, 3 columns on desktop), 7) Modal functionality works properly - clicking on a card opens the biography modal which can be closed. The leadership cards now have a more professional and visually appealing design with the photos being the dominant element."

The only minor issue is that language switching in the category modal doesn't update all field labels correctly, but this doesn't affect the core functionality."
